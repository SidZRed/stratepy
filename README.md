# stratepy: A Python Library for Game Theory Simulations, Voting Systems, and Auction Systems

stratepy is a Python library designed to facilitate simulations in game theory, voting systems, and auction mechanisms. It provides a versatile set of tools for exploring decision-making scenarios across various domains.

## Features

-   **Game Theory Simulations**: Simulate classic game theory scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and explore different strategies employed by players.
-   **Voting Systems**: Explore various voting systems, conduct simulated elections, and analyze the outcomes of different voting mechanisms.
-   **Auction Mechanisms**: Model and simulate various auction systems, including English auctions, Dutch auctions, and sealed-bid auctions. Analyze bidding strategies and auction dynamics.

## Installation

You can install stratepy via pip:

bash:
`$ pip install stratepy`
